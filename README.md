A Hands-on Experience with AWS, GCP, Azure, Terraform, and AI Integration
Cloud computing is evolving fast, and mastering MultiCloud, DevOps, and AI is crucial for modern applications. Over five intense days, I tackled the MultiCloud, DevOps & AI Challenge, where I designed, built, and deployed CloudMart, a cloud-native e-commerce solution. This journey involved working with AWS, GCP, and Azure, implementing serverless computing, containerization, infrastructure as code (IaC), and AI-driven analytics.

In this article, Iâ€™ll walk through the technical implementation, challenges, and key takeaways from this project.
